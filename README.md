# TapeCounter_Revox_B77
Arduino Nano based, digital counter for a Revox B77 Reel-to-Reel.

Original idea & code from https://old-fidelity-forum.de/thread-38940.html
Special thanks to DIYLAB-Bruno, User "Gogosch" and all that have participated - excellent work, Gentlemen!

*** this is currently work in progress ***

Version 2.0 runs smooth:
- 2 HW-006 V1.3 Line Tracker Sensor Modules
- 4 white markers on right spooling motor
- 1 EC12 RE1 360 Degree Rotary Encocer with push button
- 1 0.91 inch OLED module white 128X32
- 1 Mini DC-DC 12-24V To 5V 3A Step Down Power Supply Module 

Basic Functionality:
- Click on boot: total running hours
- Click to reset
- Turn to change from counter to meters to seconds (simple conversion - no true seconds)
- Hold to change brightness

Extended Functionality (more hardware needed):
- Pause indicator (add. Pause Memory PCB needed: eBay Mauro200id)
- Auto rewind to 0 on double click (two relais needed *** WORK IN PROGRESS ***)
